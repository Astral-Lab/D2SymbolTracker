## FAQs

### Why did I make Symbol Tracker?
> In September 2022 I started learning Web Development and wanted to put what I had learned to the test. 
> I did not feel like there was good guide and popele were still confused on how to unlock the chest.

### Can't I just watch a YouTube video or look at a picture to find the symbols?
>

### You said you released Symbol Tracker back in September, why did I not hear about it then?
> Great question! And yes, I did release it back in September. On the initial September release, Symbol Tracker only had support for the King's Fall raid, so the website
> looked much different then, if you are interested in having a look here's a link to how it looked: <insert old link here>. Also, I had only been learning WebDevelopment > for about a month when I released it, so as you can imagine the UI did not look great. 

### On Symbol Tracker there's a section called '[REDACTED]', what is this?
> Considering the past two raids (Vow of The Disciple and King's Fall) have both contained an almost identical way of obtaing a secret Deep Sight chest.
> It seemed logical to implment a section for the Lightfall raid, as it is incredbily likely it will have something similar. Escpecially now as crafting is becoming a 
> more integral part of Destiny.

### I hear you, but the Lightfall raid is not out yet, why show it on the website?
> This definately took some consideration, as I only wanted to show relevant information. The idea to keep the Lightfall section for the live release actually came from me wanting to use an awesome transition animation I created. Ultimately I decided against using it though, due to it potentially being annoying for the user. 
 
 ### What's the coffee cup logo at the bottom of Symbol Tracker?
 > As you can imagine, developing this website took a great deal of time and I will continue to update this site for as long as Destiny 2 recieves new raids, so I 
 > created a Ko-fi account to allow anyone to help support future updates to Symbol Tracker and my future projects.

 ### Any future updates planned for Symbol Tracker?
 > Yes! Updates will come in the form of adding support for new raids, UI updates (improved desktop layout), and overall bug fixes.
 > On a more techinical note, I would like to explore adding a backend to this site to reduce the number of HTML files being used.
 > For each raid, Symbol Tracker requires 11 HTML files, 1 to select the symbols, 9 for the symbol locations, and 1 for the chest unlock page. 
 > Thinking long term and assuming Bungie will implement a secret Deep Sight chest for each new raid, that would mean 22 new HTML files per year, if a new raid releases every 6 months, so the HTML files will pile up. Do not expect this to come anytime soon, it would be at least 1-2 months until such changes are implemented.

### What are you working on next?
> Stay tuned...
