## FAQs

### Why did I make Symbol Tracker?
> In September 2022 I started learning Web Development and wanted to put what I had learned to the test. 
> I did not feel like there was good guide and popele were still confused on how to unlock the chest.

### Can't I just watch a YouTube video or look at a picture to find the symbols?
>

### You said you released Symbol Tracker back in September, why did I not hear about it then?
> Great question! And yes, I did release it back in September. On the initial September release, Symbol Tracker only had support for the King's Fall raid, so the website
> looked much different then, if you are interested in having a look here's a link to how it looked: <insert old link here>. Also, I had only been learning WebDevelopment > for about a month when I released it, so as you can imagine the UI did not look great. 

### On Symbol Tracker there's a section called '[REDACTED]', what is this?
> Considering the past two raids (Vow of The Disciple and King's Fall) have both contained an almost identical way of obtaing a secret Deep Sight chest. 
> It seemed logical to implment a section for the Lightfall raid, as it is incredbily likely it will have something similar. Escpecially now as crafting is becoming a 
> more integral part of Destiny.

### I hear you, but the Lightfall raid is not out yet, why show it on the website?
> This definately took some consideration, as I only wanted to show relevant information. The idea to keep the Lightfall section for the live release actually came from me wanting to use transition animation (one that plays between page loads), 
 
 ### What's the coffee cup logo at the bottom of Symbol Tracker?
 > As you can imagine, developing this website took a great deal of time.

 ### Any future updates planned for Symbol Tracker?
 > Yes! Updates will come in the form of adding support for the new raid symbols, such as the Lightfall raid.
 > On a more techinical note, I would like to explore adding a backend to this site, to reduce the number of HTML files being used.
 > For each raid Symbol Tracker requires 11 HTML files, so when Lightfall releases.
