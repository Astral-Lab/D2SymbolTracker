## FAQs

### Why did I make Symbol Tracker?
> In September 2022 I started learning Web Development and wanted to put what I had learned to the test. 
> One of the first project ideas that came to mind was, a website to guide players through unlocking the 
> secret deep sight chest in the King's Fall raid. For a more design oriented answer see below.

### Can't I just watch a YouTube video or look at a picture to find the symbols?
> Go ahead, but Symbol Tracker provides a much smoother user experience. Why? Let's say you're doing the King's Fall raid and want to unlock the deep sight chest.
> What usually ends up happening is, maybe you take a screenshot of the symbols you need or type numbers in chat to remember them. Now, either you know all the 
> symbol locations off the top of your head, or you look at a video / picture guide. If you're using a video guide it can be frustrating to find the part of the video > you need or maybe you need to rewatch part of the video, so you try and rewind it but end up rewinding too far or too soon, which is frustrating. And if you're using
> a picture guide, well you have to scan the picture for the symbol you need, read the description, but maybe its not detailed enough, so you end up finding a video 
> guide anways, you see where I am going with this. Not to mention, if you are taking a screenshot of the symbols you need, well that takes up storage on you device,
> and if you raid a lot, that's a lot bytes being eaten up. This is why I built Symbol Tracker. It provides convience. It gives all Destiny players an incredibly easy way to unlock the secret chest.

### You said you released Symbol Tracker back in September, why did I not hear about it then?
> Great question! And yes, I did release it back in September. On the initial September release, Symbol Tracker only had support for the King's Fall raid and looked
> considerably different. If you are interested in having a look here's a link: [[old] Symbol Tracker](https://astral-lab.github.io/Symbol-Tracker-V1/).
> I would also like to add I never origianlly planned for Symbol Tracker to be available to the public, as it was just meant to be a project for me to apply what I
> had learned, the turning point came a few weeks after I had finished the first iteration of Symbol Tracker, as I felt I could significantly improve the quality of 
> the site, in terms of the UI and how I structured the code. Fast forward till now, I can say I am happy with what I have been able to
> achieve in this short amount of time and look forward to further improving the site. 

### On Symbol Tracker there's a section called '[REDACTED]', what is this?
> Considering the past two raids (Vow of The Disciple and King's Fall) have both contained an almost identical way of obtaining a secret deep sight chest,
> it seemed logical to implment a section for the Lightfall raid, as it is incredibly likely it will have something similar. Escpecially now as crafting is becoming a 
> more integral part of Destiny.

### I hear you, but the Lightfall raid is not out yet, why show it on the website?
> This definately took some consideration, as I only wanted to show relevant information. The idea to keep the Lightfall section for the live release actually came 
> from me wanting to use an awesome transition animation I created. Ultimately I decided against using it for this purpose and instead put it as the background
> animation for the Lightfall section, where you will also find a live countdown until the Lightfall release date.
 
 ### What's the coffee cup logo at the bottom of Symbol Tracker?
 > As you can imagine, developing this website took a great deal of time and I will continue to update this site for as long as Destiny 2 recieves new raids, so I 
 > created a Ko-fi account to allow anyone to help support future updates to Symbol Tracker and my future projects.

 ### Any future updates planned for Symbol Tracker?
 > Yes! Updates will come in the form of adding support for new raids, UI updates (improved desktop layout), and overall bug fixes.
 > On a more techinical note, I would like to explore adding a backend to this site to reduce the number of HTML files being used.
 > For each raid, Symbol Tracker requires 11 HTML files, 1 to select the symbols, 9 for the symbol locations, and 1 for the chest unlock page. 
 > Thinking long term and assuming Bungie will implement a secret deep sight chest for each new raid, that would mean 22 new HTML files per year, 
 > if a new raid releases every 6 months, so the HTML files will pile up. Do not expect this to come anytime soon, it would be at least 1-2 months until such changes 
 > are implemented.

### What are you working on next?
> Stay tuned...
