## FAQs

### Why did I make Symbol Tracker?
> In September 2022 I started learning Web Development and wanted to put what I had learned to the test. 

### On Symbol Tracker there's a section called '[REDACTED]', what is this?
> Considering the past two raids (Vow of The Disciple and King's Fall) have both contained an almost identical way of obtaing a secret Deep Sight chest. 
> It seemed logical to implment a section for the Lightfall raid, as it is incredbily likely it will have something similar. Escpecially now as crafting is becoming a 
> more integral part of Destiny.
