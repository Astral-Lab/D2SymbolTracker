## FAQs

### Why did I make Symbol Tracker?
> In September 2022 I started learning Web Development and wanted to put what I had learned to the test. 

### You said you released Symbol Tracker back in September, why did I not hear about it then?
> Great question! And yes, I did release it back in September. On the initial September release, Symbol Tracker only had support for the King's Fall raid, so the website
> looked much different then, if you are interested in having a look here's a link to how it looked: <insert old link here>. Also, I had only been learning WebDevelopment > for about a month when I released it, so as you can imagine the UI did not look great. 

### On Symbol Tracker there's a section called '[REDACTED]', what is this?
> Considering the past two raids (Vow of The Disciple and King's Fall) have both contained an almost identical way of obtaing a secret Deep Sight chest. 
> It seemed logical to implment a section for the Lightfall raid, as it is incredbily likely it will have something similar. Escpecially now as crafting is becoming a 
> more integral part of Destiny.

### I hear you, but the Lightfall raid is not out yet, why show it on the website?
> Good question!
